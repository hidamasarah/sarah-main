<h1> Let’s make something beautiful. </h1>

<h3>I help creative bloggers and small business owners make a remarkable impression online with gorgeous and effective web design. </h3>


<p>I am a WordPress developer and web designer, and my passion is to build blogs and websites for lifestyle bloggers and small businesses. </P>

<P>I'm here to help you, from the big changes to the small fixes. I can create a whole new site or blog for you, customize and install a new theme for you, update a theme or style you already love, or just make a few changes to fix errors and swap out content on your website or blog.  </P>

<P>Below, you’ll find the packages I offer, along with standard extras. If you need help choosing what’s right for you, or if you want to discuss adding on other custom extras, please reach out for a free phone or video consultation. I love talking about site design and brand strategy, and I’d love to talk through your project with you. </p>
